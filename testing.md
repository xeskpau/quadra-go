# Testing Documentation

This document outlines the testing strategy and test cases for the QuadraGo application.

## Testing Strategy

The application uses a combination of:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for user flows

## Test Cases

### Authentication Tests

1. **User Login Test**
   - Test that users can log in with valid credentials
   - Test that appropriate error messages are shown for invalid credentials
   - Test that users are redirected to the feed page after successful login

2. **User Signup Test**
   - Test that users can create a new account with valid information
   - Test that appropriate validation errors are shown for invalid inputs
   - Test that users are redirected to the feed page after successful signup

3. **Google Authentication Test**
   - Test that users can log in using Google authentication
   - Test that user information is correctly retrieved from Google

### Sports Center Tests

1. **Sports Center Listing Test**
   - Test that sports centers are correctly displayed in the list view
   - Test that sports center details are accurate

2. **Sports Center Filtering Test**
   - Test that filtering by sport works correctly
   - Test that filtering by date works correctly
   - Test that filtering by time works correctly
   - Test that combined filters work correctly

3. **Sports Center Map Test**
   - Test that sports centers are correctly displayed on the map
   - Test that map markers show the correct information
   - Test that clicking on a marker opens the sports center details

### Booking Tests

1. **Slot Availability Test**
   - Test that available slots are correctly displayed
   - Test that unavailable slots are correctly marked

2. **Booking Process Test**
   - Test that users can book an available slot
   - Test that booking confirmation is displayed
   - Test that booked slots are marked as unavailable after booking

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

For end-to-end tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Test Implementation Status

- [ ] Authentication Tests
- [ ] Sports Center Listing Tests
- [ ] Sports Center Filtering Tests
- [ ] Sports Center Map Tests
- [ ] Booking Tests

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for all components
2. Set up integration tests for component interactions
3. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
4. Set up continuous integration for automated testing
